# instagram-username-filter
A script that's capable of processing a large set of instagram usernames (1 million+). We will upload a txt.file to the script and it should utilize an OpenAI API key to filter out names that do not correspond to male individuals from the USA or Europe. The filtered list should then be outputted as a .txt file.
